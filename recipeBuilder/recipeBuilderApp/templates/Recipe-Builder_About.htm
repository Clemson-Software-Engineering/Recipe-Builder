   <h1>About Recipe-Builder</h1>

   <p>Using Kroger's API, our team has created this open source app in order to make
      grocery shopping easier than ever before. Recipe-Builder is designed
   to allow anyone to input a recipe they've found or love, as well as their current
      location. In return, the app will then show them the location and price of each of the
    items in their recipe at their nearest Kroger store.</p>

   <p>As new features are constantly being added to Recipe-Builder, future grocery shoppers
      can expect to be able to create their own accounts and even save all of their favorite
      recipes for later use. No more wasting time searching for lost recipes!</p>
